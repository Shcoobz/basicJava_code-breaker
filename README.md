## Summary

CodeBreaker Cipher Tool is a Java application that enables encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher. It's designed to facilitate learning about different ciphers and their use in cryptography, featuring an interactive command-line interface for easy operation.

The core functionality includes:

- Encrypting or decrypting messages using the Caesar or Vigenere Ciphers.
- Maintaining application state with details of the last operations.
- Providing an interactive user interface for easy message manipulation.

## Features

### Caesar Cipher

Encrypt or decrypt messages using a user-defined shift value, ideal for basic encryption experiments.

### Vigenere Cipher

Utilize a keyword to perform polyalphabetic encryption or decryption, offering a more complex cipher technique.

### Interactive Console

A user-friendly command-line interface that guides users through encryption or decryption processes.

### Application State Management

Keeps track of the last used cipher, action, and messages, allowing users to review previous inputs and results.

## Additional Features

- **Future Expansion**: Plans to include more ciphers like Atbash, Substitution, and Transposition Ciphers.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Improvements to the interface and feedback mechanisms are under consideration.
- **Cryptanalysis Tools**: Integration of tools for breaking ciphers and analyzing security is a planned update.
- **File I/O Support**: Future versions will aim to support encrypting and decrypting messages from files.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The backbone for the application, providing robust and reliable performance.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Employs a simple CLI for interactions, making it accessible to beginners and advanced users alike.
